Dark forces conspired against them, seeking to thwart their quest and unleash chaos upon the world. And lurking in the shadows, a figure from Aria's past watched and waited, biding his time until the moment was right to reveal himself.\n\nChapter 3: The Trial of Fire\n\nTheir next trial awaited them in the fiery depths of Mount Emberstone, where an ancient dragon guarded the key to unlocking the secrets of the prophecy.
